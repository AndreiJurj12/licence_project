The stock market can be defined as a loose network of economic transactions of stocks (also called shares) which represent ownership claims on businesses. The act of investing has changed a lot during recent years becoming more and more automated through various electronic platforms which even try to predict the actual movement of the market.

There are many strategies which may be adopted by an investor, but ultimately they reduce to the most important task: the capability of predicting to some degree the movement of the market. In this thesis, we will evaluate the reliability of machine learning for tackling this problem. Technical analysis seeks to determine the future price of a stock based only on the previous trends of the price without taking into account details and fundamentals of the company.
